# Nessie-s-Revenge

## What is it?
A CLI game modeled after the popular game battleship.

## Why is nothing/very little here yet?
This project is currently being ported from the work I have already done in Java into Python, since I changed my mind about the implementation language I wanted to use. In a few days there should be significantly more code, so check back!

## A note on folder names
The client and server folders are labeled as such to demonstrate the way concerns should be separated. My intention is to add a client-server implementation later, but I want to have this plan on my mind throughout early development.
