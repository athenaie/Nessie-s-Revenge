# Nessie-s-Revenge

Nessie's Revenge is a CLI implementation of battle ship. The name is based on
the name of the Loch Ness Monster, Nessie. Instead of leading a fleet of ships,
each player has an army of lake monsters from around the world.

## Dependencies

### Client
- `Python3.*` is required to run the client

## Why is nothing/very little here yet?
This project is currently being ported from the work I have already done in Java
into Python, since I changed my mind about the implementation language I wanted
to use. In a few days there should be significantly more code, so check back!

## A note on folder names
The client and server folders are labeled as such to demonstrate the way concerns should be separated. My intention is to add a client-server implementation later, but I want to have this plan on my mind throughout early development.
