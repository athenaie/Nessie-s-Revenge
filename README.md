# Nessie-s-Revenge

Nessie's Revenge is a CLI implementation of battle ship. The name is based on
the name of the Loch Ness Monster, Nessie. Instead of leading a fleet of ships,
each player has an army of lake monsters from around the world.

## Dependencies

### Client
- `Python3.*` is required to run the client

## Current Progress
Currently there is only development on the client. Most of the data structures have been designed and implemented for storing information about the player, their maps, and their monsters. Although server and client message handlers have not been developed yet, a draft of the communication protocol has been developed (see documentation).
